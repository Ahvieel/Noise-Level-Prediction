Predictive Analysis on Noise Production

#### NOISE LEVEL PREDICTION
Noise Pollution is a growing issue in many urban areas and it can have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the people residing in these areas. In order to effectively address this issue, itâ€™s important to be able to predict and measure noise levels accurately. 
A project aims to do just that by using regression analysis to create a model that can predict the noise levels of a given location based on various factors. This model can be used to inform policy decisions and interventions that can help to reduce noise pollution and improve quality of life.
Objective: The goal of this project is to predict the noise level of a given location based on the various factors given in the dataset. The model will take into account various factors like location, days and time of the day. The aim is to create a model that is as accurate as possible in predicting noise levels.
Method: Statistical analysis using regression models to determine the correlation between the noise level and the other factors.
